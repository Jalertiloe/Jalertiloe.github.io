			<td>Audio Projects</td>
			<td><span class="title"> Audacity</span><br/> This is a collection of audio projects completed during my school's
			Digital Design class. It ranges from scripts, and music mixes to a year in review.

			<td>Video and Flash Projects</td>
			<td><span class="title"> Movie Maker</span><br/>This is a collection of video and Flash projects from my school's 
			Digital Design class. This includes multiple advertisments and a few flash games.

		<tr>
			<td>Paddle Ball</td>
			<td><span class="title"> Scratch</span><br/>This is my first project I completed with Girls Who Code in 2016.
			During our first week we used a free programming language, created by MIT called
			Scratch. This is a simple paddle game in which the score and speed increases every time
			the unicorn touches the paddle.

		<tr>
			<td>Pig</td>
			<td><span class="title"> Scratch</span><br/>This is the second project that I completed with Girls who code in 2016. This was also 
			created during our first week in Scratch. The point of this game is for player one to get predetermined number
			of points before player two while avoiding rolling a one with negates all points earned in the current round.</td>
			<td><img src =  "PIG.jpg" title = "Pig" 
			border = 1 height=300 width=400></img></td>
		<tr>
			<td>Jukebox</td>
			<td><span class="title"> Scratch</span><br/>This was also created during the first week of Girls Who Code. Music was added note by note in order to 
			create songs which were stored as lists. By pressing the numbered buttons you add the list to a
			larger list. After added or deleting songs, you execute the play command.</td>
			<td><img src =  "Jukebox.jpg" title = "Jukebox" 
			border = 1 height=300 width=400></img></td>
		<tr>
			<td>Obamicon</td>
			<td><span class="title"> Python</span><br/>This was created during the second week of Girls Who Code as an introduction to Python
			and PILLOW. The goal was to emulate the "Obama Hope" poster.</td>
			<td><img src =  "obamacon.jpg" title = "Obamicon" 
			border = 1 height=300 width=400></img></td>
		<tr>
			<td>Snow Animation</td>
			<td><span class="title"> Python</span><br/>This was created during the second week of Girls Who Code as an introduction to Pygame. The goal was to 
			create a procedure that randomly created circles in such a way that they appeared to be moving downward.</td>
			<td><img src =  "Snow.jpg" title = "Snow Animation" 
			border = 1 height=300 width=400></img></td>
		<tr>
			<td>Bouncing Ball</td>
			<td><span class="title"> Python</span><br/>This was created during the third week of Girls Who Code. This encorparated creating two circles with 
			randomly genrated colors for the objects and the background while allowing  them to "bounce" off of the borders
			.</td>
			<td><img src =  "bouncing ball.jpg" title = "Bouncing Ball" 
			border = 1 height=300 width=400></img></td>
		<tr>
			<td>City Scroller</td>
			<td><span class="title"> Python</span><br/>Also created during the third week of Girls Who code, was the begining of a game created in Python with the 
			pygame library. This program randomly generated rectangles that moved across the screen without changing size
			to simulate an abtract cityscape.</td>
			<td><img src =  "City Scroller.jpg" title = "City Scroller" 
			border = 1 height=300 width=400></img></td>
		<tr>
			<td>Runner Game</td>
			<td><span class="title"> Python</span><br/>On the final day of week three, we combined the skills learned in the bouncing ball activity and the city
			scroller activity to create a functional "runner game". The game initially used the mouse as the main
			controls and later the arrow keys were used as controls. During this project, we learned how to implement sprites
			and to use classes from outside of the file.</td>

		<tr>
			<td>Robot Dance</td>
			<td><span class="title"> C++</span><br/>After only two days of learning C++ in Arduino, ten groups of four girls programmed robots to dance and flash
			LEDs to	chosen music. The one depicted to the left was the one created by my group, Groffsauce, created a robot
			in the likeness of King George III from <span class="italic"> Hamilton An American Musical</span> to the song
			<span class="italic"> You'll be Back </span>. This robot was featured in a segment of People to People. </td>
			<td><img src =  "Kingjorge3.jpg" title = "Robot Dance" 
			border = 1 height=300 width=229></img></td>
		<tr>
			<td>Robot Whiskers</td>
			<td><span class="title"> C++</span><br/>On the final day of week four we devled into the basics of machine learning. This project displayed
			a more practical use of movement in a robot. We used whisker sensors to guide the robot through a maze. </td>
			<td><img src =  "whiskerbot.jpg" title = "Robot Whiskers" 
			border = 1 height=300 width=400></img></td>
		<tr>
			<td>Break Society's Barriers</td>
			<td><span class="title"> Python</span><br/>This game was created as my final project for the Girls
				Who Code Summer Immersion Program. We were tasked with creating something 
				using the information we had learned over the course of seven weeks.
				I wanted to make something that would have an Impact on people so, I created
				a game in which you destroy negative comments siad about people daily.</td>
